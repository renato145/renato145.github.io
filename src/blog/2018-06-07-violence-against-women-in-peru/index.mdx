Peru has one of the highest rates of violence against women in the region[^1]. How bad is the problem? let's take a look at some public data.


## Public data

The Demographic and Family Health Survey: ENDES[^2], is one of the most important statistical research carried out continuously in Perú. It provides information on reproductive, maternal and child health, and family violence.

In this post we will be looking at some of the family violence variables that were publicly available[^3]:
* **Physical violence:** percentage of women between 15 and 49 who have suffered physical violence from their husbands or partners.
* **Psychological violence:** percentage of women between 15 and 49 who have suffered psychological violence from their husbands or partners.
* **Sexual violence:** percentage of women between 15 and 49 who have suffered sexual violence from their husbands or partners.

## Violence variables by region

The numbers are quite high: in 2016, on average, 65% of women have suffered some kind of abuse, in some regions nearly half of the women have been victims of physical abuse and 7 regions have more than 10% victims of sexual violence. There is certainly a lot of work to do.
