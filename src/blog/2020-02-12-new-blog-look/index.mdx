It's been a while since my last post, hopefully I can start to do it more often now.

In the last few months I have been playing more with some JS libraries for visualization. I have been really liking to work with [react](https://reactjs.org), [d3](https://d3js.org) and [threejs](https://threejs.org). So, in order to show more of my work I've decided to change [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) as my site generator to [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org).
